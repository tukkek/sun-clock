# Sun Clock

Sun Clock is a simple 24-hour system-tray clock that has noon as the top-most position (representing the zenith of the Sun in the sky) and that runs counter-clock-wise, like the Sun rising from the east.

Hovering or right-clicking the icon will show the exact 24-hour time and describe the current time in relation to night (0:00-5:00), morning (6:00-11:00), afternoon (12:00-17:00) and evening (18:00-23:00).

It's a simpler way to organize the passing of the day in accordance to natural time, compared to the arbitrary 24-hours of the clock. It's probably not for most people but perhaps a more Zen time-keeping.

## Installation

1. Install Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
1. Download and extract the package (https://github.com/tukkek/sun-clock/releases).
3. In the extracted directory, run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Test the installation by running the `clock.py` script.

You can optionally configure Sun Clock to start automatically (consult your operating-system documentation) and also remove your system clock if you don't want two clocks running at the same time.
